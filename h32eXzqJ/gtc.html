                <aside>
                    <p>
                        There is a strong need for medical research in neurological diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and other neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders. Such research is essential for developing new therapies and improving health care in these conditions. A key advancement in modern medical science is the active involvement of patients through the structured collection of treatment data and the administration of therapy-related surveys. APST Research GmbH supports these research efforts by providing mobile research applications that collect and manage research-related data for medical studies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1.1 These general terms and conditions of use (GTC) apply to the use of services of APST Research GmbH (hereinafter referred to as "APST Research"), and the use of mobile software applications, including the "ALS App", “ALS Research App”, "SMA App” and “Neurofilament App” and other mobile applications (hereinafter referred to as "APST Research Apps").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.2 The services of APST Research support patients (and their relatives) with chronic, serious, or rare diseases to participate in medical research projects. Patients are authorized as users of APST Research Apps and receive individual user accounts. The legal basis for this is derived from the individual agreements made upon the conclusion of the contract and these GTC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.3 By using APST Research Apps, the patient (or legal representative) agrees to the terms and conditions and the privacy policy. The APST Research reserves the right to change these GTC, if necessary, particularly for factual and/or legal reasons, with reference to these reasons. The amended terms and conditions will be sent to the patient (or legal representative) by e-mail one month before they come into effect, to the e-mail address last provided to APST Research. If the patient has not objected within 4 weeks of receipt of the e-mail, the amended terms and conditions shall be deemed accepted. They shall govern the future contractual relationship between the patient and APST Research. If the patient (or his legal representative) objects, the contract terminates in accordance with clause 4.2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.4 The Patient may not assign the rights and obligations under this agreement. Therefore, the assignment of rights is excluded.

APST Research offers a free telephone briefing before using Apps and, if necessary, further free, individually arranged training courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.6 With the patient's consent, their data is released to medical partners for viewing, processing and use. The patient is free to revoke their initial consent at any time with immediate effect without giving reasons. APST Research shall ensure that the corresponding declaration of consent meets all legal requirements, particularly those relating to data protection.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        5.1 The patient must protect his access data (user name, password) carefully and like valuables from unauthorized access by third parties. The patient is expressly recommended to use antivirus, antispyware, firewall software, and current operating system versions. If the patient uses outdated hardware and/or operating system versions, the correct display of APST Research Apps may be limited. In this case, the patient can obtain information about suitable operating systems and their versions from APST Research.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5.2 The Patient undertakes not to post any illegal content on APST Research Apps or to make it accessible to third parties, for example, through forums, chat rooms, e-mail, or spam. Violations of contractual use restrictions entitle APST Research to take appropriate remedial action, including blocking the user's account. The patient is informed, in this case, immediately of the type, duration, cause, and extent of the blockage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5.3 The accuracy of the data and information given by the patient is crucial for the quality of APST Research's services. As a result, the patient agrees that APST Research cannot be held responsible for any claims from third parties who rely on the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the data and information provided.

                        7.1 APST Research is subject to the data protection regulations of the Federal Republic of Germany, the European Union (EU GDPR), in particular Articles 6 and 9 GDPR and 235.1 Federal Act of 19 June 1992 on Data Protection (FADP). APST Research is obliged to protect the data of patients and other parties involved on the basis of these provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7.2 APST Research takes all organizational and technical precautions necessary according to the currently common standards to meet the requirements of data protection law, particularly to secure patient data against unauthorized access by third parties. The stored data is transmitted via the World Wide Web from the server to the patient's mobile device and vice versa using the SSL encryption standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7.3 The patient expressly declares his consent to the collection, processing, and use of his data by APST Research within the scope of the contractually intended purposes and by a separate privacy policy.

                    <p>
                        8.2 In case of slight negligence, APST Research shall be liable without limitation for injuries to life, body, or health caused by APST Research as well as its legal representatives and/or vicarious agents.

                    <p>
                        8.4 Apart from that, APST Research shall only be liable insofar as a guarantee of quality has been assumed, or an essential contractual obligation (cardinal obligation) has been violated. The term "cardinal obligation" refers abstractly to those obligations whose fulfilment is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on whose compliance the patient may regularly rely. In such cases, liability is limited to compensation for foreseeable, typically occurring damage.

The results of the assessments will be used for scientific evaluation and may be published only in aggregated, pseudonymised and/or anonymised form, without naming or identifying the patient, and only to the extent covered by the patient's consent and the APST Research Privacy Policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10.2 The evaluations must be objective and may not contain any illegal content. APST Research is not liable for the accuracy, quality or completeness of the assessments. APST Research will remove inappropriate or illegal evaluations upon clear indication.

                        11. Final provisions
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        11.1 If any provision of the contract is or becomes invalid or void, this shall not affect the validity of all other provisions. Instead, the invalid or void provision shall be replaced by a valid provision that comes as close as legally possible to the purpose pursued by the invalid or void provision. Such practices shall also apply to any loopholes in the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        11.2 The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply. The legal regulations on the restriction of choice of law and on the applicability of compelling regulations, particularly the state where the patient has his or her usual stay as a patient, remain untouched. Suppose the patient is a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law. In that case, the registered office of APST Research shall be the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from the contractual relationship.
